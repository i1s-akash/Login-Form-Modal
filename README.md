# Login-Form-Modal
I completed another day of jQuery where the project name is Login Form Modal/Popup so here i have learned lots of things which all are new to me like method getBoundingClientRect() and its properties.(Would like to mention one thing, I wanna build a great UI but is having lots of other work that's why i didn't.) 3rd Day of jQuery Code
